# Dijkstra

This repository contains VSC solutions that implement:

* 3 implementations of Dijkstra algorithm that solve exercises 21, 25 and 26 in chapter 8 of [Jeff Erickson's book *Algorithms*](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/). Part of course work for an *Optimization* course.

* Very silly implementations of Prim and Kruskal algorithms that find the minimum spanning tree for the graph in Figure 7.1 (page 258) in the previously mentioned book.
